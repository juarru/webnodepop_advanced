```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/juarru/webnodepop.git
```

### Installing

Once downloaded or cloned the project, you need to access to the directory using the console:

```bash
$ cd <project_directory> 
```

Then you can install Nodepop:

```bash
$ npm install
```

All the modules needed for running the server will be install at that moment. Nodepop will be ready for run.

## Running MongoDB

To use the service, first thing you have to do is start the database service. If it´s the first time you use [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), please follow the next instructions:

- Unzip the file you downloaded previously.
- Copy the unzipped folder with mongoDB where you want.
- Using a console, go to the directory where you copy mongo folder:

```bash
$ cd <mongoDB_directory>
```

```bash
$ bin/mongod --dbpath ./data/db --directoryperdb
```

In this moment mongoDB is running, listening by default at `port=27017`

## Running WebNodepop

### Option One - Install example data

Perhaps you want to test the project using some previous data. Perfect!!!, you can do it. Before starting WebNodepop, please execute the next instruction into the nodepop´s directory:

```bash
$ npm run installDB
```

You have now one user and some commercials in the database ready to use.
The users information are:

name | email | key
-----|-------|-----
User | user@example.com | 1234 

You can use them later for [authentication](#authentication) testing, the same as commercials, that you will get using the API.

Now you can start WebNodepop service:

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Option two - Run empty

You only want to start the service and introduce the data later using the API instruction. Ok, please, start the service:

```bash
$ npm start
```

## Debugging WebNodepop

In that case is possible you want to use a debugging mode to analize more in depth how the service is working. For this situation you can run WebNodepop this way:

```bash
$ npm run debug

If the operation is done, you will receive a success response with a token:

```js
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjU3MmNkMDQ5NTc3MjM4NzEzMjllZGRmNyIsImlhdCI6MTQ2MjU1NTk1MiwiZXhwIjoxNDYyNzI4NzUyfQ.EclGk2iIvTNUMUsgU1pyWmwk9q0rmAV81Lc--PrcpQ4"

  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication failed. Invalid password"
}
```

## API - Commercials

    sell: {type: Boolean, required: true},
    price: {type: Number, required: true},
